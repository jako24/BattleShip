#BattleShipGame
This is a Python implementation of the classic game of Battleship. In this game, two players (a human player and the computer) take turns trying to guess the location of each other's ships on a grid. The first player to sink all of the other player's ships wins.

#Getting Started
To play the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You can also clone this repository to your local machine using git:
```
fgit clone https://github.com/your_username/BattleShipGame.git
```

#How To Play 
To start the game, run the main.py file in a Python interpreter:
```
python main.py
```
The game will display two grids: one grid is the player's board (where the player will place their ships), and the other grid is the computer's board (where the player will try to guess the location of the computer's ships).

To place a ship on the player's board, the player will need to enter the row and column where they want to place the ship. The game will prompt the player to enter the row and column separately.

To guess the location of the computer's ships on the computer's board, the player will also need to enter the row and column where they want to guess. The game will again prompt the player to enter the row and column separately.

The game will continue until either the player or the computer has sunk all of the other player's ships.
